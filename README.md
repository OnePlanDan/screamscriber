Hold the key. Speak. Text appears. Wow.

## API Server

Screamscriber can host an OpenAI-compatible transcription API, so other apps or a second Screamscriber instance can send audio over the network for transcription.

See the [API Documentation](./assets/api_docs.html) for endpoints, examples, and chaining setup.
